# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## Creating Changesets

To create a new changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Versioning

When you're ready to version packages, run:

```bash
pnpm version-packages
```

This will consume all changesets, update package versions, and update CHANGELOG.md files.

## Publishing

When you're ready to publish, run:

```bash
pnpm release
```

This will publish all packages that have new versions.

## Lockstep Versioning

All `@cgk/*` packages are configured for lockstep versioning. This means all packages
will have the same version number, similar to React or Next.js.
