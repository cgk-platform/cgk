# CGK Platform — Deferred / Complex Task Queue

**Purpose:** Tasks that proved too risky, too deep, or too architecturally complex to implement safely in this pass.
These are flagged for review with Claude Opus via Claude Code.

**Format per entry:**
```
## [TASK-ID] Short title
- **Source:** MASTER-TASK-LIST.md section + agent
- **Why deferred:** Brief reason (spinning wheels, tech debt risk, unclear spec, etc.)
- **What was tried:** What the agent attempted or explored
- **Recommended next step:** What a more advanced model / human should do
```
